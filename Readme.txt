# Arduino-based-Home-Automation-
This is my final year mini project for subject Artificial Intelligence & Robotics (AIR).

In this project, we designed a simple home automation system using simple components.
using this simple component different electrical appliances can switched on or off automatically. 
The project is based on Arduino and we have used Arduino UNO for this project. 

Hardware Requirement 
 • Arduino Uno 
 • Bluetooth – HC05 
 • Relay Board 
 • Tungsten Bulb 
 • Connecting Wires 
 • AC power supply(230v) 
 
 
Software Requirement 
 • Arduino IDE 
 
 
Steps for implementing this project:

step 1: Download and install Arduino IDE on your system
step 2: Open provided ".ino" file in Arduino IDE 
step 3: Connect Arduino to your system and upload the code written in ".ino" file into 	your Arduino
step 4: After uploading the code into Arduino, take a small magnet and take it nearer to relay switch
step 5: By doing the above process, it will automatically turn on and off the light. 
        
which means when the doors of our house are closed,the lights of the room will turn off 
and as soon as when the doors get open, the lights will automatically turn on.
